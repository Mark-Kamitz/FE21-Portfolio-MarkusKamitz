According to the idea: **"I love to create - and watch my creation unfold"** I created a little **"creators game"** on the homepage to 
convey the experience to create and watch the creation unfold in front of your eyes. Just **klick on the screen and create some light magic** and enjoy the experience.


**The task: Your portfolio page should contain the following:**

Personal details(what you are comfortable with to share on a public website),
Technologies you know(incl. future technologies- e.g. upcoming Backend technologies)
Projects/assignments/exercise examples that you have completed(here you can extend the already existing codereviews and adapt them to your liking)
